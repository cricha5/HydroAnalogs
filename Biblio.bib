  abstract={Several recent experiments were devoted to walkers, structures that associate a droplet bouncing on a vibrated liquid with the surface waves it excites. They reveal that a form of wave-particle duality exists in this classical system with the emergence of quantum-like behaviours. Here we revisit the single particle diffraction experiment and show the coexistence of two waves. The measured probability distributions are ruled by the diffraction of a quantumlike probability wave. But the observation of a single walker reveals that the droplet is driven by a pilot wave of different spatial structure that determines its trajectory in real space. The existence of two waves of these types had been proposed by de Broglie in his "double solution" model of quantum mechanics. A difference with the latter is that the pilot-wave is, in our experiment, endowed with a "path memory". When intrusive measurements are performed, this memory effect induces transient chaotic individual trajectories that generate the resulting statistical behaviour.}

abstract ={A droplet bouncing on a liquid bath can self-propel due to its interaction with the waves it generates. The resulting “walker” is a dynamical association where, at a macroscopic scale, a particle (the droplet) is driven by a pilot-wave field. A specificity of this system is that the wave field itself results from the superposition of the waves generated at the points of space recently visited by the particle. It thus contains a memory of the past trajectory of the particle. Here, we investigate the response of this object to forces orthogonal to its motion. We find that the resulting closed orbits present a spontaneous quantization. This is observed only when the memory of the system is long enough for the particle to interact with the wave sources distributed along the whole orbit. An additional force then limits the possible orbits to a discrete set. The wave-sustained path memory is thus demonstrated to generate a quantization of angular momentum. Because a quantum-like uncertainty was also observed recently in these systems, the nonlocality generated by path memory opens new perspectives.},

  abstract={Resonances usually result from wave superpositions in cavities where they are due to the wave spatio-temporal folding imposed by the boundaries. These energy accumulations are the signature of the cavity eigenmodes. Here we study a situation in which wave superposition results from the motion of a source emitting sustained overlapping waves. It is found that resonances can be produced in an unbounded space, the boundary conditions being now defined by the trajectory. When periodic trajectories are investigated, it is found that for a discrete subset of orbits, resonant wave modes are excited. Trajectory eigenmodes thus emerge. These modes have three attributes. Their associated resonant wave fields are the Fourier transform of the source's trajectory. They are non-radiative and they satisfy the perimeter Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule.}
